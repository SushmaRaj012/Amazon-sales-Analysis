## Approach used

**Data preparation**: we will clean preprocess the dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory data analysis**: We'll analyze the data to understand the distribution of products by categories, customer ratings, and reviews.

**Data visualization**: We'll visualize the data to identify trends and patterns.

**Data Preparation Process in SQL**

1. **Data Import**
   - Loaded the dataset into SQL

   
2. **Data Inspection**
   - Checked for missing values in  columns to identify gaps.
   - Identified duplicate records to ensure data uniqueness.
   - Verified data types to confirm consistency and accuracy.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Standardized date formats and corrected inconsistencies in categorical data.

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Created new calculated fields where necessary to enhance analysis.
   - Converted data types where required for consistency and accuracy.
   - Standardized naming conventions and formatted values appropriately.

5. **Data Saving**
   - Saved the cleaned and transformed dataset into a new table to preserve the original data.
   - Synced the final dataset from SQL to Power BI for visualization and insights.

**Analysis:**
**Product Analysis**

Perform an analysis on the data to gain insights into different product lines,the goal is to identify top-performing categories and highlight areas for improvement to enhance overall sales and customer satisfaction
